#From the equation, we can see that this is an ARIMA model with P=4, D = 0, Q = 0
### P = 4 | D = 0 | Q = 0. The ARIMA model selects this automatically
### p=4 means model uses 4 auto regressive terms
### d=0 means differencing was not applied in this model.
### q=0 means model 0 moving average terms were included in the model
### Overall, model is Autoregressive moving Average model with 4 lagged autoregressive terms,
### 0 moving average term and a constant term.

#Assumed Hare as the y variable

#Why is this model appropriate?
# From the ACF plot, we can see that autocorrelation is decreasing. The ACF plot is varying sinusoidally.
#The data may follow an ARIMA(p,0,0) model if the ACF and PACF plots  show the following patterns:
#- the ACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal;
#- there is a significant spike at lag pin the PACF, but none beyond lag p. Here, we can see spike in the PACF, plot at lag = 4 which states that that model ARIMA(4,0,0) is appropriate.
#Also there is no need for data differencing as the plot is horizontal. so d = 0. Data is stationary.

### For our forecasts we will be using ARIMA model specified by part b of the question.
### The model has order P=4|D=0|Q=0 meaning it is an autoregressive model with
### 4 lagged autoregressive terms and a constant term

### As you can see we got pretty similar values for manual calculations and forecasts made by r. 
### Slight difference between manual calculations and forecasts made by r are due to the fact that we
### did not consider error terms in our calculation because they were not given.
